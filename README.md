Cloudify is a modern and user-friendly mobile application designed to provide real-time weather
information along with practical clothing suggestions based on the current weather conditions.
Built using Flutter, a powerful framework for cross-platform mobile development, Cloudify offers
a seamless experience for users on both Android and iOS platforms.

The app leverages an external weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch accurate and up-to-
date weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, and city names. One of the standout
features of Cloudify is its clothing suggestion system, which recommends appropriate attire based
on the current weather. This feature makes the app not only informative but also highly practical
for everyday use.
Additionally, Cloudify enhances the user experience with dynamic backgrounds and animations
that change according to the weather conditions. For example, a sunny day displays a bright, warm
background with a sun animation, while a rainy day shows a dark, moody background with rain
animations. These visual elements make the app engaging and visually appealing
